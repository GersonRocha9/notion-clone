<h1>Introduction to Tailwind CSS</h1>
<p>
  Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that allows you to rapidly
  build custom user interfaces. It provides a set of pre-defined utility
  classes that you can combine to create styles for your elements. Lets
  take a look at a simple example:
</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">console.log("Hello, world!")</code></pre>

  The code above demonstrates how you can use Tailwind CSS to create a
  blue-colored element with white text and a bolded element inside. This
  is achieved by applying utility classes like "bg-blue-500",
  "text-white", and "font-bold" to the element.

    Tailwind CSS allows you to focus on building your user interface
    without worrying about writing custom CSS styles from scratch. By
    leveraging its utility classes, you can quickly style your elements
    and maintain consistency throughout your project.

<p>
  It's worth mentioning that Tailwind CSS also provides responsive
  utilities, allowing you to create different styles for various screen
  sizes. For example:
</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">console.log("Hello, world!")</code></pre>

<p>
  With Tailwind CSS, you have the flexibility to customize and extend the
  framework to suit your project's specific needs. It provides an
  excellent balance between design efficiency and customizability, making
  it a popular choice for many developers.
